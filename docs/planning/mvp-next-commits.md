# Next development work

RF-RUNTIME-005B19 [root-scoped review and reconciliation v2](../architecture/hermes-root-scoped-review-reconciliation-v2.md) is implemented and synthetically qualified. Ordinary safe coding paths are
acceptance scope, while protected paths remain blocked. Durable private evidence
precedes verification, terminal receipt, owned cleanup and lease/Writer release.
Future recovery requires a complete identity chain and separate explicit owner
authority. The real B17 legacy dry run refuses seven missing evidence requirements;
its Writer, application lease and all spent records remain unchanged. The sole
next owner action is a decision on a separately scoped legacy-only recovery
exception; no bypass or new run follows. ADR-004 is v11 for this policy amendment,
profile/registry stay v5, native-risk binding stays v7 and all six public flags
remain false. Earlier successor/version statements below are historical.

RF-RUNTIME-005B18 [source/synthetic diagnosis](../architecture/hermes-b18-footprint-diagnosis-v1.md) is complete,
but real B17 root-cause attribution and lock-recovery proof remain **BLOCKED**.
Minimal repair/test and completed atomic replacement pass the unchanged footprint;
undeclared paths or byte-identical undeclared rewrites can trigger violations.
Loss of diagnostic evidence before fixture deletion is confirmed. The retained
Writer/lease match each other but lack the complete spent/process identity chain.
Both artifacts remain untouched. Only B19 root-scoped protected-path policy,
durable evidence ordering and guarded reconciliation are proposed; deletion needs
separate owner approval plus currently missing proof. ADR-004 stays v10, all six
public flags stay false, and no provider started in B18. Earlier next-atom
statements below are historical.

RF-RUNTIME-005B17 [one-shot coding smoke](../architecture/hermes-b17-coding-smoke-v1.md) is **BLOCKED** after
one authorized provider start under ADR-004 v10. Root exit 0 was rejected by
native review (unexpected_changed_path); exact repair and independent test PASS
were not established. Genuine Job cleanup and owned fixture removal passed.
Separate post-result full installation readback passed without receipt changes.
Writer and one application lease remain held for reconciliation; all B13/B14/B17
authorizations are spent. All six public flags remain false. Exactly one proposed
successor is B18 source-only footprint diagnosis and reconciliation-plan
qualification, with no runtime/private mutation or new execution. Earlier
B16/no-launch/version-9 and successor statements below are historical.

RF-RUNTIME-005C [native owned-job qualification](../architecture/windows-owned-process-job-v1.md)
is complete for local fixture process lifetime/cleanup. Native receipt validation
is required per attempt; missing proof remains fail-closed.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B4 same-owner qualification](../architecture/hermes-same-owner-profile-v1.md)
is complete using explicit private owner attestation. A stable account ID is not
required. Installed CLI help does not establish secret-free status output; no
status command was run and availability is not claimed. Attestation is checked
at sealing/pre-spawn, expires within 90 days, and requires explicit renewal on
expiry/revocation or reported account/session/config changes. Silent account
switches and unreported session loss remain residual risks.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B5 effective-config qualification](../architecture/hermes-effective-config-qualification-v1.md)
is BLOCKED: exact-pin loader data is partial, with intercepted read/import attempts
and unqualified startup/tool/rotation consumers. Its private negative receipt grants
no Ready/admission authority. [RF-RUNTIME-005B6 source analysis](../architecture/hermes-minimal-startup-contract-v1.md)
recorded NOT_SUPPORTED for strict minimal startup. B7 resolves that requirement
through explicit owner acceptance of local skills sync/banner prefetch, with
network updates off. Exact Worker startup policy and Ready/input-bound receipt are
implemented and synthetically tested; only the local config blocker is removed
with fresh proof. Real Hermes launch remains denied.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B8 attempt/budget qualification](../architecture/hermes-attempt-budget-contract-v1.md)
remains historical evidence of missing physical dispatch/token boundaries.
RF-RUNTIME-005B9 owner amendment supersedes those pilot requirements with the
[implemented practical attempt policy](../architecture/hermes-practical-attempt-budget-v1.md):
24 logical turns; retry setting 2; original deadline at most 900 seconds;
native cleanup; no resume or whole-task restart; unavailable accounting null;
exit 0 only candidate_result for independent review. Private v3 profile is read
back with owner identity/confirmation/expiry preserved. This is synthetic/native
fixture qualification, not real Hermes execution. All six flags remain false.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B11 native audited coding](../architecture/hermes-native-tool-boundary-v1.md)
is implemented under ADR-004 v7. Owner acceptance resolves B10's one pending
risk decision; authority, v4 startup, leases, manifests and owned cleanup have
synthetic qualification. Native tool isolation remains technically incomplete;
violations block review/release and unobserved/transient effects remain accepted
risk. Only fresh opaque proof removes the local native-tool blocker. All six
flags remain false. [RF-RUNTIME-005B12 local launch admission](../architecture/hermes-local-launch-admission-v1.md)
is source/synthetic qualified with a single opaque, expiring, one-use proof set.
Local policyQualified can be true while activationAuthorized=false and
spawnStarted=false. B11 cleanup is closed by verified owner removal.
RF-RUNTIME-005B16 [controlled rebuild and split attestation](../architecture/hermes-controlled-rebuild-v1.md)
is **DONE**. The unchanged exact source pin now has a verified canonical venv
with 83 original distributions, no optional AWS closure, 23,653 immutable files
and 826 separately verified generated files. Profile v5 and the sealed Worker
environment deny lazy installation. Owner identity/confirmation/expiry, private
data and B13/B14 spent records are preserved. Staging/rollback cleanup and fresh
file-only admission passed. No Hermes/model run or new activation occurred.
ADR-004 execution decision remains v9 and all six public flags remain false.
Earlier next-step/lock/launch statements below are historical.

The repository cleanup established a stable baseline for continued product
development. No Codex Agent Host issue queue is stored in the repository.

## Recommended order

First-agent direction remains native Hermes behind Windows Worker under
[ADR-004 version 10](../decisions/ADR-004-native-hermes-codex-pilot.md).
[RF-RUNTIME-005A quiet v1](../architecture/hermes-supervised-quiet-v1.md) retains
stable 0.21.2 and removes stream-json waiting from the supervised pilot scope.
RF-RUNTIME-005B3 prepares a private profile and synthetic admission binding under
the accepted same-owner auth policy. B4 qualifies private owner attestation, with
unobserved CLI status and residual account-switch risk; no model run, upgrade or
automatic pilot authority follows.
Native whole-tree recovery now has fixture evidence; remaining
configuration/auth/tool/turn/budget blockers still require proof. All six runtime
flags remain false. Direct CLI is an alternative, Herdr optional, VM/Sandbox is
not a prerequisite. Future local Ollama stays planned/disabled until confirmed
disk expansion and separate qualification; routing never hides a fallback.

Other product work remains available independently of that runtime decision:

1. Run the application locally and verify the owner flows against a disposable
   development database.
2. Review each `00`-`12` department workbench with real workspace data and
   record product gaps as normal issues outside the repository.
3. Finish the first owner-authorized Google Drive import.
4. Refresh production deployment identity only after an approved release.
5. Add focused regression tests alongside every changed runtime contract.

## Definition of ready

A change is ready to commit when typecheck, structural lint and build pass,
relevant tests pass, documentation matches behavior, and no generated cache or
sensitive local artifact is staged.
