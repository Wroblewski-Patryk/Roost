# Open decisions

RF-RUNTIME-005C [native owned-job qualification](../architecture/windows-owned-process-job-v1.md)
is complete for local fixture process lifetime/cleanup. Native receipt validation
is required per attempt; missing proof remains fail-closed.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B4 same-owner qualification](../architecture/hermes-same-owner-profile-v1.md)
is complete using explicit private owner attestation. A stable account ID is not
required. Installed CLI help does not establish secret-free status output; no
status command was run and availability is not claimed. Attestation is checked
at sealing/pre-spawn, expires within 90 days, and requires explicit renewal on
expiry/revocation or reported account/session/config changes. Silent account
switches and unreported session loss remain residual risks.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B5 effective-config qualification](../architecture/hermes-effective-config-qualification-v1.md)
is BLOCKED: exact-pin loader data is partial, with intercepted read/import attempts
and unqualified startup/tool/rotation consumers. Its private negative receipt grants
no Ready/admission authority. Exactly one next atom: **RF-RUNTIME-005B6 — source-only
selection of an upstream-supported minimal startup path and resolution of remaining
tool/rotation controls**. Not started. The 0.21.2 pin, native Job lifecycle and all
six false runtime gates remain unchanged.

The first-provider choice is resolved by RF-RUNTIME-002 /
[ADR-004](../decisions/ADR-004-native-hermes-codex-pilot.md): native Hermes using
Codex OAuth behind Windows Local Worker; direct CLI alternative and Herdr optional.
Workspace, one-writer, cleanup, secrets, Ready/review and release guards remain.
No VM/Windows Sandbox/Hyper-V prerequisite. No runtime activation follows.

## Same-owner authentication — attestation qualified, runtime still blocked

[RF-RUNTIME-005A](../architecture/hermes-supervised-quiet-v1.md) accepts public
quiet/oneshot on existing stable 0.21.2 for the first supervised pilot. Waiting
for unreleased stream-json is no longer required; older rejection evidence remains
historical. B1/B2 profile-only isolation findings remain historical after the B3
owner amendment. B4 accepts the explicit owner attestation as authoritative for this single-owner
pilot; technical account identity is not required. No OAuth or model operation
occurred in B3/B4. Fresh owned-tree receipts remain mandatory;
effective config, auth/tool
boundaries, internal turns and hard budgets remain unqualified; all six runtime
flags stay false. Config completion must not be reported as pilot readiness.

Local Ollama with OpenAI gpt-oss or Mistral/Devstral is **PLANNED/DISABLED**.
Installation waits for confirmed disk expansion and resource/quality qualification.
Later routing is explicit by competencies, risk, quality, cost, resources and
privacy, with visible escalation and no automatic fallback.

## Accepted foundations

- PostgreSQL is the canonical operational data store.
- The API is the supported write boundary for web clients, agents and
  integrations.
- Owner registration creates a workspace; business records and integration
  settings are workspace-scoped.
- ClickUp is the first native provider adapter; n8n remains optional.
- The React owner console is the human control plane.
- Codex Agent Host and other agents are external supervised clients. They do not own
  Roost's product model or repository state.
- Production uses reviewed Prisma migrations and a Coolify-compatible Docker
  deployment.

Add new unresolved decisions here only when they materially affect scope,
ownership, architecture or release safety.
