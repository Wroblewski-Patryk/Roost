# Open decisions

RF-RUNTIME-005B17 [one-shot coding smoke](../architecture/hermes-b17-coding-smoke-v1.md) is **BLOCKED** after
one authorized provider start under ADR-004 v10. Root exit 0 was rejected by
native review (unexpected_changed_path); exact repair and independent test PASS
were not established. Genuine Job cleanup and owned fixture removal passed.
Separate post-result full installation readback passed without receipt changes.
Writer and one application lease remain held for reconciliation; all B13/B14/B17
authorizations are spent. All six public flags remain false. Exactly one proposed
successor is B18 source-only footprint diagnosis and reconciliation-plan
qualification, with no runtime/private mutation or new execution. Earlier
B16/no-launch/version-9 and successor statements below are historical.

RF-RUNTIME-005C [native owned-job qualification](../architecture/windows-owned-process-job-v1.md)
is complete for local fixture process lifetime/cleanup. Native receipt validation
is required per attempt; missing proof remains fail-closed.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B4 same-owner qualification](../architecture/hermes-same-owner-profile-v1.md)
is complete using explicit private owner attestation. A stable account ID is not
required. Installed CLI help does not establish secret-free status output; no
status command was run and availability is not claimed. Attestation is checked
at sealing/pre-spawn, expires within 90 days, and requires explicit renewal on
expiry/revocation or reported account/session/config changes. Silent account
switches and unreported session loss remain residual risks.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B5 effective-config qualification](../architecture/hermes-effective-config-qualification-v1.md)
is BLOCKED: exact-pin loader data is partial, with intercepted read/import attempts
and unqualified startup/tool/rotation consumers. Its private negative receipt grants
no Ready/admission authority. [RF-RUNTIME-005B6 source analysis](../architecture/hermes-minimal-startup-contract-v1.md)
recorded NOT_SUPPORTED for strict minimal startup. B7 resolves that requirement
through explicit owner acceptance of local skills sync/banner prefetch, with
network updates off. Exact Worker startup policy and Ready/input-bound receipt are
implemented and synthetically tested; only the local config blocker is removed
with fresh proof. Real Hermes launch remains denied.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B8 attempt/budget qualification](../architecture/hermes-attempt-budget-contract-v1.md)
remains historical evidence of missing physical dispatch/token boundaries.
RF-RUNTIME-005B9 owner amendment supersedes those pilot requirements with the
[implemented practical attempt policy](../architecture/hermes-practical-attempt-budget-v1.md):
24 logical turns; retry setting 2; original deadline at most 900 seconds;
native cleanup; no resume or whole-task restart; unavailable accounting null;
exit 0 only candidate_result for independent review. Private v3 profile is read
back with owner identity/confirmation/expiry preserved. This is synthetic/native
fixture qualification, not real Hermes execution. All six flags remain false.
[RF-RUNTIME-005B11 native audited coding](../architecture/hermes-native-tool-boundary-v1.md)
is implemented under ADR-004 v7. Owner acceptance resolves B10's one pending
risk decision; authority, v4 startup, leases, manifests and owned cleanup have
synthetic qualification. Native tool isolation remains technically incomplete;
violations block review/release and unobserved/transient effects remain accepted
risk. Only fresh opaque proof removes the local native-tool blocker. All six
flags remain false. [RF-RUNTIME-005B12 local launch admission](../architecture/hermes-local-launch-admission-v1.md)
is source/synthetic qualified with a single opaque, expiring, one-use proof set.
Local policyQualified can be true while activationAuthorized=false and
spawnStarted=false. B11 cleanup is closed by verified owner removal.
RF-RUNTIME-005B16 [controlled rebuild and split attestation](../architecture/hermes-controlled-rebuild-v1.md)
is **DONE**. The unchanged exact source pin now has a verified canonical venv
with 83 original distributions, no optional AWS closure, 23,653 immutable files
and 826 separately verified generated files. Profile v5 and the sealed Worker
environment deny lazy installation. Owner identity/confirmation/expiry, private
data and B13/B14 spent records are preserved. Staging/rollback cleanup and fresh
file-only admission passed. No Hermes/model run or new activation occurred.
ADR-004 execution decision remains v9 and all six public flags remain false.
Earlier next-step/lock/launch statements below are historical.

The first-provider choice is resolved by RF-RUNTIME-002 /
[ADR-004](../decisions/ADR-004-native-hermes-codex-pilot.md): native Hermes using
Codex OAuth behind Windows Local Worker; direct CLI alternative and Herdr optional.
Workspace, one-writer, cleanup, secrets, Ready/review and release guards remain.
No VM/Windows Sandbox/Hyper-V prerequisite. No runtime activation follows.

## Same-owner authentication — attestation qualified, runtime still blocked

[RF-RUNTIME-005A](../architecture/hermes-supervised-quiet-v1.md) accepts public
quiet/oneshot on existing stable 0.21.2 for the first supervised pilot. Waiting
for unreleased stream-json is no longer required; older rejection evidence remains
historical. B1/B2 profile-only isolation findings remain historical after the B3
owner amendment. B4 accepts the explicit owner attestation as authoritative for this single-owner
pilot; technical account identity is not required. No OAuth or model operation
occurred in B3/B4. Fresh owned-tree receipts remain mandatory;
effective config, auth/tool
boundaries, internal turns and hard budgets remain unqualified; all six runtime
flags stay false. Config completion must not be reported as pilot readiness.

Local Ollama with OpenAI gpt-oss or Mistral/Devstral is **PLANNED/DISABLED**.
Installation waits for confirmed disk expansion and resource/quality qualification.
Later routing is explicit by competencies, risk, quality, cost, resources and
privacy, with visible escalation and no automatic fallback.

## Accepted foundations

- PostgreSQL is the canonical operational data store.
- The API is the supported write boundary for web clients, agents and
  integrations.
- Owner registration creates a workspace; business records and integration
  settings are workspace-scoped.
- ClickUp is the first native provider adapter; n8n remains optional.
- The React owner console is the human control plane.
- Codex Agent Host and other agents are external supervised clients. They do not own
  Roost's product model or repository state.
- Production uses reviewed Prisma migrations and a Coolify-compatible Docker
  deployment.

Add new unresolved decisions here only when they materially affect scope,
