# Open decisions

No product or architecture decision currently blocks development.

## Accepted foundations

- PostgreSQL is the canonical operational data store.
- The API is the supported write boundary for web clients, agents and
  integrations.
- Owner registration creates a workspace; business records and integration
  settings are workspace-scoped.
- ClickUp is the first native provider adapter; n8n remains optional.
- The React owner console is the human control plane.
- Paperclip and other agents are external supervised clients. They do not own
  Roost's product model or repository state.
- Production uses reviewed Prisma migrations and a Coolify-compatible Docker
  deployment.

Add new unresolved decisions here only when they materially affect scope,
ownership, architecture or release safety.
